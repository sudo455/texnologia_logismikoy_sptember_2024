# TODO List for Data Mining and Analysis Project

## Completed Tasks

- [x] Create basic Streamlit app structure
- [x] Implement data loading functionality (CSV, Excel, TSV)
- [x] Implement PCA and UMAP visualizations
- [x] Add exploratory data analysis charts
- [x] Implement feature selection algorithm
- [x] Implement classification algorithms (KNN and SVM)
- [x] Add performance comparison for classification algorithms
- [x] Create basic "About" page

## Remaining Tasks

### Application Development

- [ ] Refine UI/UX design
- [ ] Add error handling and input validation
- [ ] Implement data preprocessing options (e.g., handling missing values, normalization)
- [ ] Add more exploratory data analysis options
- [ ] Implement cross-validation for more robust performance evaluation
- [ ] Add option to save/export results and visualizations

### Docker

- [ ] Create Dockerfile for the application
